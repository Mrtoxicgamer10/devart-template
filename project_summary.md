## Description
The Android Smart Ring is an inspired device from smart-watches but has an unique Design,Specifications and can do beyond possibilities.

I am an College Student who got this project Idea. I just want to give this project a Go and see if I can make it a success. I wanna give people a whole new experience of Technology. It's a unique Idea which has never been done, if previously it's done then that must be not as good as this one. The Android Smart Ring features a curved 720p display, Bluetooth v4.0, NFC, High Clarity Speakers, Microphone, powered by 1GHz processor, 512MB RAM, couple of required sensors, has Transistors (acting as a battery which requires no charging) and this ring runs on Android KitKat (or) Android Wear (in near future).
